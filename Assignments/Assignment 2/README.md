#### 2.a You need to write Code for multi-variable linear regression 
Functions of your code should be easily readable and reusable.

Given a data set attached with this message (CarPrice_Assignment.csv) . The data set is about predicting the car price based on features given(such as height, width, power, etc.)
Only use following features to train your model 
* carlength
* carwidth
* carheight
* enginesize
* stroke
* horsepower
* price

Split the data set into training and testing data set in 80:20 ratio.
Train your model with the training data set and report the accuracy of your model based on testing data set.
